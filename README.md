# Starter

In this course, we will use [Bun] to create projects, bundle ressources
and run development servers. If you haven't installed Bun yet, we
recommend using a package manager such as [Scoop] (Windows) or
[Homebrew] (Mac) to do so.

```sh
# Windows
scoop install bun

# Mac
brew install oven-sh/bun/bun
```

Before starting a homework or an exercise, run the following command to
initialize a new project (replace `<name>` with the name of the homework
or exercise):

```sh
bun create 582-41F-VA/starter <name>
```

To start the development server, run `bun dev` from your project's root
directory.
